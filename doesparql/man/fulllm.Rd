\title{
Shortcut to create a linear model with all factors.
}
\description{
This is a simple shortcut function to create a linear model with all
factors of the original experiment with all interactions. This is
specific to the published experiment and there are
probably more elegant ways of doing this, but it is included for completeness.
}
\usage{
fulllm(results)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{results}{
The \code{data.frame} containing the results from \code{sparqlEval}.
}
}

\value{
A linear model for the experiment.
